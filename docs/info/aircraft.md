# Supported Aircraft
---

!!! info
    Note: The aircraft could still be partially or be fully supported after an update if the interior switches weren't modified.

!!! success
    If you'd like to see your aircraft get supported, open an issue and we'll see if it's possible! In the future, there will be a easy way to add aircraft yourself!

!!! info
    If a mod does not modify the interior file of an aircraft and is solely performance or visual upgrades, you can use the base aircraft file for synchronization.
