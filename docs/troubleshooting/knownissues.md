## Could Not Connect To The YourControls Gauge

### Possible Cause #1
You have special characters in your windows username. You should try renaming your windows user as MSFS has trouble loading in WASM modules if you have special characters in the name.

### Possible Cause #2
You have not restarted the simulator. Restart the simulator after installing YourControls.

### Possible Cause #3
When YourControls was installed all or parts of the app were installed to the wrong location.

1. Exit Microsoft Flight Simulator if it's running
2. Download, extract and run the [installer](../usage/installing.md#automated-installer)
3. When re-installing, verify the installer paths are correct. **The first path is the install location** (Where you want to launch YourControls from) and **the second path is the location of your MSFS Community folder.**
