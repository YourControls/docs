## What is YourControls?
YourControls is a program that allows multiple people to connect their simulators into a single shared flight deck. Tasks can be distributed among crewmates, where one can fly the aircraft, while another handles the radios and autopilot. Doing flights on VATSIM and other online networks have never been more immersive.
